# Utils Folder

This folder contains utility functions that can be reused across the application.

For example:
- hashPassword.js: Contains logic to hash passwords using bcrypt (this is only an example, this utility is not in use).

Put any helper functions or utilities that are used in multiple parts of the application here.
