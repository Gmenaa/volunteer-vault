# Controllers Folder

This folder contains logic that handles incoming requests and sends responses.
Controllers manage application logic for specific actions like registering, logging in, or logging out users.

For example:
- authController.js: Handles user authentication actions such as login, register, and logout.

Put any other logic that deals with manipulating data or processing requests here under its own controller.
